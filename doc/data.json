Defining a class</h3> \n([Back to index](#index))\n\nThe `$def` operator is required in order to define classes. In fact, `$def` is a function and it accepts an object of arguments as\ninput parameter. The essential parameters are:\n\n- **$constructor** *(optional)*. The constructor of the class is a method called first when an instance of some class is created. If no constructor is provided, jOOPL automatically creates a default parameterless constructor.\n- **$members** *(optional)*. An object containing the methods and properties for the whole class.\n\nA basic class may look like the next code listing:\n\n    var A = $def({\n        // Constructor \n        $constructor: function() {\n            this.$_.name = null;\n        },\n        $members: {\n            get name() {\n                return this.$_.name;\n            }\n\n            set name(value) {\n                this.$_.name = value;\n            }\n\n            sayYourName: function() {\n                alert(\"Hey, \" + this.name)\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n\n<h4 id=\"class-fields\">1.1 Class fields</h4> \n([Back to index](#index))\n\nA class field is a variable declared in the class that can be accessed from any member (constructors, properties and methods).\n\nAny class constructor, property or method has a reserved variable called `$_` accessible through `this.$_` on which class fields can be declared and\nmanipulated. For example, `this.$_.myName = \"Matias\";` will declare a class field called `myName` with a default value `Mat√≠as`.\n\n    var A = $def({\n        $constructor: function() {\n            // This is a class field:\n            this.$_.value = \"A string for the class field\";\n        }\n    });\n\n<h4 id=\"class-constructors\">1.2 Constructors</h4>\n([Back to index](#index))\n\nIn classes, the constructor is a method/function called once an instance of some class is created. That is, this is a good moment for initializing \nthe whole class.\n\nFor example, class constructors are the place to define class fields:\n\n    var A = $def({\n        // Constructor \n        $constructor: function() {\n            this.$_.myName = \"Matias\";\n        }\n    });\n\nIn instance, the class constructor has access to the already declared methods and properties:\n\n    var A = $def({\n        // Constructor \n        $constructor: function() {\n            this.$_.myName = \"Matias\";\n\n            // The \"someMethod()\" method can be called from the constructor!\n            this.initialize();\n        }\n\n        $members :{\n            initialize: function() {\n                alert(\"hello world called from the constructor!\")\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n##### See also\n\n- [Call parent class constructor](#class-baseconstructor)\n\n<h4 id=\"class-properties\">1.3 Properties</h4>\n([Back to index](#index))\n\nAny class can declare properties. Apparently, a property looks like a variable in its usage, but it differs from variables on\nhow they are declared.\n\nProperties are the best way to encapsulate the access to private resources held by the class like class fields or calculated values. \n\nA property is composed by two possible parts (it can have both or only one of them)\n\n- **Getter**. It is a block like a function defining how a value is obtained.\n- **Setter**. It is a block like a function defining how to set a value.\n\nFor example, without properties, an object would look like the next code listing:\n\n    var myObject = {\n        name: \"Matias\",\n        age: 28\n    };\n\nAnd once the `myObject` variable holds the new object, both `name` and `age` can be altered:\n\n    myObject.name = \"John\";\n    myObject.age = 33;\n\nBut what happens if there is a need to constraint the `name` and `age` variables? A primitive solution would be:\n\n    var possibleName = \"John\";\n    var possibleAge = 33;\n\n    if(possibleName != \"John\") {\n        myObject.name = possibleName;\n    } else {\n        throw Error(\"Sorry, John, I do not like you!\")\n    }\n\n    if(possibleAge > 30) {\n        myObject.age = possibleAge;\n    } else {\n        throw Error(\"You are too young! Please try again in some years...\");\n    }\n\nThis is how the above code would be implemented using properties:\n\n    var myObject = {\n        // Some regular variables\n        _name: null,\n        _age: null,\n\n        // A getter for the _name variable:\n        get name() { \n            return this._name; \n        },\n        // A setter for the _name variable. The setter defines the validation logic!\n        set name(value) { \n            if(value != \"John\") {\n                this._name = value; \n            } else {\n                throw Error(\"Sorry, John, I do not like you!\")\n            }\n        },\n\n        // A getter for the _name variable:\n        get age() { \n            return this._age;\n        },\n        // A setter for the _name variable. The setter also defines the validation logic here!\n        set age(value) {\n            if(value > 30) {\n                myObject.age = value;\n            } else {\n                throw Error(\"You are too young! Please try again in some years...\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nNow, if some code tries to assign \"John\" or an age lesser than 30, the properties setters will throw the error, but this time\nthe validation logic is encapsulated:\n\n    myObject.name = \"John\" // ERROR\n    myObject.name = \"Matias\" // OK\n\n    myObject.age = 28 // ERROR\n    myObject.age = 33 // OK\n\njOOPL fully supports JavaScript 1.8.x properties like the described before:\n\n    var A = $def({\n        $constructor: {\n            // Define a class field for later provide access to it through a property getter and setter\n            this.$_.name = null;\n        },\n        $members: {\n            // Gets the value held by the this.$_.name class field:\n            get name() {\n                return this.$_.name;\n            },\n\n            // Sets a new value to the this.$_.name class field:\n            set name(value) {\n                this.$_.name = value;\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    var instance = new A();\n\n    // Set the 'name' property value\n    a.name = \"Matias\";\n\n    // Gets the name property value\n    alert(a.name); // Alerts \"Matias\"\n\n\n<h4 id=\"class-methods\">1.4  Methods/Functions</h4>\n([Back to index](#index))\n\nMethods (*also known as functions*) are the behavior of classes. They are the actions that can be performed by the class. Examples\nof methods can be:\n\n- do\n- create\n- notify\n- write\n- build\n- ...\n\nClass methods are defined as regular JavaScript functions and as part of the `$members` in a class definition:\n\n    var A = $def({\n        $members: {\n            do: function() {\n                return \"do what?\";\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n##### See also\n\n- [Polymorphism](#class-polymorphism)\n\n<h4 id=\"class-events\">1.5 Events</h4> \n([Back to index](#index))\n\n##### Events glossary\n\n- **Event**. It is an observable action. Classes defining them or others can subscribe to events and react to them.\n- **Event handler**. It is a function assigned to the event which is called when the event happens.\n\nEvents are the new jOOPL's out-of-the-box feature that enables any class to create observable objects.\n\nAn observable object is a one emitting notifications when something happens within it. For example, an event may be:\n\n+ When some button is clicked.\n+ An asynchronous operation completed.\n+ An item was added to a list.\n\nEvents are class members like properties and methods, but they are special in terms of how they are declared. For example, \nif a class needs to implement an event to notify to others that it said \"hello world\", an event \"saying\" would be declared this way:\n\n    var A = $def({\n        $members: {\n            $events: [\"saying\"]\n        }\n    });\n\nThe above code declares an event \"saying\". Events are declared as an array of identifiers (names) as value of the `$events` special member. Once\nan event is declared, the next step is triggering/raising/firing it somewhere in the whole class:\n    \n    var A = $def({\n        $members: {\n            $events: [\"saying\"],\n\n            helloWorld: function() {\n                // This is triggering the event. jOOPL has created an special function called\n                // 'saying' which can receive an object of arguments so the object suscribed to\n                // the class event will receive the whole argument 'text'\n                this.saying({ text: \"yes, the object is about to say 'hello world'!\"});\n\n                // The event 'saying' notified that the class A was about saying something\n                // and, finally, now it says \"hello world!\" using an alert.\n                alert(\"hello world!\")\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\nFinally, the last step is listening for the `saying` event. For that matter, an instance of A is created and the code will set an event handler in order\nto do an action when the `A` class instance says something:\n\n    var instance = new A();\n\n    instance.saying = function(args) {\n        // The `args` input argument will hold the text set when the event was triggered\n        alert(\"The instance said: \" + args.text);\n    };\n\nOnce an event handler added to an event, it is possible to *unsuscribe* from it: it is as easy as trying to set the same handler to the event.\n\nFor example:\n\n    var instance = new A();\n\n    var handler = function(args) {\n    }\n\n    // This adds an event handler to the event\n    instance.saying = handler;\n\n    // Setting the same handler again removes it from the event.\n    instance.saying = handler;\n\n\n<h3 id=\"class-instances\">2. Creating instances of classes</h3>\n([Back to index](#index))\n\nOnce a class is defined using the `$def` keyword, an instance of the class must be created in order to use it. \n\nIn jOOPL and JavaScript, a class is a standard constructor function and instances can be created using also the standard\n`new` operator:\n\n    var A = $def({\n        $members: {\n            someMethod: function() {\n                alert(\"hello world\");\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    // Creating an instance of A:\n    var instance = new A();\n\n    // Now the instance variable - a reference to an object of type A - \n    // has its instance methods available to be called:\n    instance.someMethod();\n\n<h3 id=\"class-oop\">3. Object-oriented programming on JavaScript using jOOPL</h3> \n([Back to index](#index))\n\nDefining classes and creating instances of it using the `$def` and `new` operator respectively are just the most basic features of jOOPL.\n\njOOPL introduces an state-of-the-art and powerful class inheritance and polymoprhism mechanism that elevates the JavaScript language to \nwhat makes something true object-oriented programming:\n\n- **Inheritance**. Classes can inherit from others in order to share their behaviors, properties and events.\n- **Polymorphism**. Class methods can be overriden by derived classes (ones inheriting a base class), keep the inherited members signature but alter their implementation.\n- **Encapsulation**. Classes expose their behavior thanks to their members, and the implementation details are hidden to the code consuming a class.\n\n<h4 id=\"class-inheritance\">3.1 Class inheritance</h4>\n([Back to index](#index))\n\nInheritance is one of the most important concepts in object-oriented programming. That is, some class can derive from other.\n\nThe `$def` keyword supports an additional and optional parameter called `$extends` which specifies that the declaring class extends another class.\n\nA class `A` may implement some methods and properties and a class `B` can inherit `A` and it will not need to implement them as all members from `A`\nare already available as members of `B`:\n\n    // Defining a class A having a method \"do()\"\n    var A = $def({\n        $members: {\n            do: function() {\n                // Do some stuff\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    // Class B extends A\n    var B = $def({\n        $extends: A\n    });\n\n    var instance = new B();\n\n    // The B instance can invoke the do() function \n    // inherited from A\n    instance.do();\n\njOOPL supports single inheritance. It means that a class can derive another class but not from multiple classes (*no multi-inheritance*), but any\nclass can inherit other. There is no limitation of how many levels of inheritance can implement an hierarchy. \n\nAn important detail is that, if a class does not directly inherit a class (there is no `$extend` input parameter for `$def` keyword), it will \nimplicitly inherit the top-most class `Object` implemented as a plain JavaScript prototype, which provides basic methods and properties that any class \nwill contain. At the end of the day, **any class inherits Object**.\n\n<h4 id=\"class-polymorphism\">3.2 Inheritance with polymorphism </h4>\n([Back to index](#index))\n\nPolymorphism is a key feature and it is tied to inheritance: it is the ability of an inherited member - methods and properties - to override the base\nimplementation found in the parent class. \n\nFor example, there is a class called `Salutation` which implements a method/function `sayHello` and it returns **\"hello world\"**, and there is a derived class\n`SpecializedSalutation` that inherits `Salutation` class, the whole derived class can override the `sayHello` method and make it say **\"Hello, world!\"**:\n\n    var Salutator = $def({\n        $members: {\n            sayHello: function() {\n                return \"hello world\"\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    var SpecializedSalutator = $def({\n        $extends: Salutator,\n        $members: {\n            // Overrides the parent class sayHello implementation\n            sayHello: function() {\n                return \"Hello, world!\";\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    var instance = new SpecializedSalutator();\n    var text = instance.sayHello();\n\n    // This will alert \"Hello, world!\" as the class has overriden the default implementation\n    // which was returning \"hello world\"\n    alert(text); \n\n<h4 id=\"class-base\">3.2.1 The `this.$base` keyword</h4>\n([Back to index](#index))\n\nAny method/function or property is overridable. But what makes polymorphism even more powerful is the chance to call the base implementation from the\noverriden member.\n\nThe overriden members may or may not call the parent class member implementation using the `this.$base` keyword. \n\nFor example, there is a class `Calculator` having a method `add`, and a specialized calculator called `UnsignedCalculator` which makes any addition an absolute result,\nthe code would look like this:\n\n    var Calculator = $def({\n        $members: {\n            add: function(num1, num2) {\n                // It simply adds num2 to num1\n                return num1 + num2;\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    var UnsignedCalculator = $def({\n        $members: {\n            add: function(num1, num2) {\n                // This is calling the \"add\"'s parent class implementation\n                var result = this.$base.add(num1, num2);\n\n                // Now the result from calling the base implementation of this method\n                // is converted to an unsigned number\n                return Math.abs(result);\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n<h4 id=\"class-baseconstructor\">3.2.2 The derived class constructor calls the parent's class constructor</h4> \n([Back to index](#index))\n\nEven class constructors can call their parent class constructor. This is extremely useful if the parent class or another class in the same\nhierarchy requires some construction-time initialization:\n\n    // The top-most parent class Person defines basic data\n    // and provides getter and setter properties in order to\n    // get or set the whole contained data.\n    //\n    // The constructor receives as arguments the default data.\n    var Person = $def({\n        $constructor: function(args) {\n            this.$_.name = args.name;\n            this.$_.secondName = args.secondName;\n            this.$_.age = args.age;\n        },\n        $members: {\n            get name() {\n                return this.$_.name;\n            },\n            set name(value) {\n                this.$_.name = value;\n            },\n\n            get secondName() {\n                return this.$_.secondName;\n            },\n            set secondName(value) {\n                this.$_.secondName = value;\n            }\n\n            get age(){\n                return this.$_.age;\n            },\n            set age(value) {\n                this.$_.age = value;\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    // The Employee class inherits Person and adds\n    // more data. The Employee constructor both defines\n    // new class fields and calls the Person's constructor\n    // by invoking this.$base.$ctor(args), thus the base constructor\n    // will receive the expected arguments.\n    var Employee = $def({\n       $extends: Person,\n       $constructor: function(args) {\n            this.$base.$ctor(args);\n\n            this.$_.companyName = args.companyName;\n            this.$_.salary = args.salary;\n       } \n    });\n\n    // Now this is creating an instance of Employee. As the Employee constructor\n    // calls its base Person class' constructor, it will be correctly initialized \n    // with the data passed as constructor arguments:\n    var instance = new Employee({\n        name: \"Matias\",\n        secondName: \"Fidemraizer\",\n        age: 28,\n        companyName: \"ACME\",\n        salary: 99999\n    });\n\n    alert(instance.name); // Popups \"Matias\"\n    alert(instance.secondName); // Popups \"Fidemraizer\"\n    alert(instance.age); // Popups \"28\"\n    alert(instance.companyName); // Popups \"ACME\"\n    alert(instance.salary); // Popups \"99999\"\n\n<h4 id=\"class-basecallsderived\">3.2.3 A base class member calls the most specialized implementation</h4> \n([Back to index](#index))\n\nSometimes it is needed that some method or property in the base class may able to call some most specialized member implementation.\n\nFor example, a parent class `Polygon` overrides the default JavaScript `toString()` method in order to calculate the polygon area and\nreturn it as a string. That is, `Polygon` implements a `calcArea` method. Now `Square` inherits `Polygon` and overrides the `calcArea`\nmethod and performs the whole area calculation. The `Square` class will now need to override the base `toString()` `Polygon`'s method in order to\nshow the area.\n\nIn jOOPL, the most derived or specialized member is accessed through the special class field `this.$_.$derived`. \n\nHere is a sample of the above explanation:\n\n    var Polygon = $def({\n        $members: {\n            calcArea: function() {\n                // A generic polygon will not know how to calculate the area. The\n                // derived classes will do it!\n            },\n\n            toString: function() {\n                // See how calcArea() from the most derived class is accessed:\n                return \"The area of this polygon is: '\" + this.$_.$derived.calcArea(); + \"'\";\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    var Square = $def({\n        $constructor: function(args) {\n            this.$_.x = args.x;\n            this.$_.y = args.y;\n        },\n        $extends: Polygon,\n        $members: {\n            get x() {\n                return this.$_.x;\n            },\n            get y() {\n                return this.$_.y;\n            },\n\n            calcArea: function() {\n                return this.x * this.y;\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    var instance = new Square(20, 30);\n    \n    // This will alert \"The area of this polygon is: '600'\"\"\n    alert(instance.toString());\n\n<h3 id=\"class-istypeof\">3.3 The isTypeOf operator</h3> \nThe `isTypeOf` operator is a function/method present in any instance of a class defined by jOOPL. \n\nIt evaluates if an instance is of type of some given class. An interesting point is `isTypeOf` evaluates\neither if the instance is of type of the most derived class or it can check if an instance is of type of\na given base class (polymorphism).\n\nFor example, if there is a class `A`, `B` and `C`, and `C` inherits `B` and `B` inherits `A`:\n\n    var instanceOfC = new C();\n\n    var isType = instanceOfC.isTypeOf(A); // Evals true!\n    isType = instanceOfC.isTypeOf(B); // Evals true!\n    isType = instanceOfC.isTypeOf(C); // Evals true!\n\n    var instanceOfA = new A();\n\n    isType = instanceOfA.isTypeOf(C); // Evals false - A is not C!\n    isType = instanceOfA.isTypeOf(B); // Evals false - A is not B!\n    isType = instanceOfA.isTypeOf(A); // Evals true!",

            "description": "Registers a namespace. The whole method supports two scenarios:\n\n- Register a namespace and later add members by accessing it with its full path (i.e. $global.your.namespace).\n- Register a namespace and create a scoped function where the `this` keyword holds the registered namespace.\n\nIn both scenarios, jOOPL will check if the whole namespace path is already registered. If it is not the case, it will register the\nnamespace path, and if it was already registered, it just skips the namespace path registration.\n\n####1. Simple register a namespace\nThe first use case of the `$namespace.register` method is just about registering a namespace and later access it with its full path:\n    \n    $namespace.register(\"joopl.samples\");\n\n    $global.joopl.samples.SomeClass = $def({ \n        $members: {\n            someMethod: function() {}\n        }\n    });\n\n####2. Register a namespace and add classes or other members inside a scoped function\nThe second use case of the `$namespace.register` is the most powerful one: both register the whole namespace and add members to the\nit in the same operation and with a shorter syntax. \n\n`$namespace.register` supports a second parameter in addition to the namespace path called `scopedFunc`. It is a parameterless function that, when\nexecuted,  the `this` keyword in the scope of the function (i.e. *the function body*) will be the childest registered namespace. For example:\n\n    $namespace.register(\"joopl.samples\", function() {\n        // The this keyword now is the 'samples' namespace! \n        // That's great because there is no need to access to the full namespace path\n        // to work on adding members to it!\n        this.ClassA = $def({\n            $members: {\n                someMethod: function() {\n                    return \"hello world\";\n                }\n            }\n        })\n    });",
